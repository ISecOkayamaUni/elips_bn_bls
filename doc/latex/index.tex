E\+Li\+PS\+: Stands for Efficient Library for Pairing based Security. The main goal of this library is to give the reaserchers a tool that can be easy to install, configure and use. With a basic idea of pairing-\/based crypto anyone can be able to use this library for their reserach of protocols. We would like to update this library as incremental basis along side of our research activity to include the contemporary algorithmic improvements.\hypertarget{index_Licensing}{}\section{Licensing}\label{index_Licensing}
